# Currency bot

I learn best by doing things. This sample AI...thing. Is an arbitrary use case I created to help guide my learning.

The overall idea is to create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) app that is somehow better than a standalone LLM like chatGPT or LLAMA and doing some kind of currency analysis. At a minimum, that could just mean it looks up the current currency conversion rates and gives up to date conversions. However, it could be further advanced to somehow become a "currency" expert.

I will be taking snapshots of progress along the way, so we can see how the app changes over time. The files will have a `-part-<number>` to indicate which version it is. 

I'm going to use Ollama to run [llama 3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) and build on top of that

## Naive Approach


* Part 1
* Part 2
